## Tasks Description

### 1. Map the environment

* You may use any SLAM algorithm you like, any type:
  * 2D LiDAR
  * 3D LiDAR
  * Vision
  * Multi-sensor
* Verify your SLAM accuracy by comparing your odometry with the published `/gazebo/ground_truth/state` topic (`nav_msgs::Odometry`), which contains the gournd truth odometry of the robot.
* You may want to use tools like [EVO](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo) to quantitatively evaluate the performance of your SLAM algorithm.

### 2. Using your own map, navigate your robot

* We have provided you a GUI in RVIZ that allows you to click and generate/clear the random objects in the gazebo world:
  
  ![rviz_panel_image](src/me5413_world/media/control_panel.png)

* From the starting point, move to one of the four given destination boxes at the end of the map:
  * Count the number of occurance of each type of box (e.g. box 1, 2, 3, 4, the box numbers are randomly generated)
  * Cross the bridge (the location of the bridge is randomly generated)
  * Unlock the blockade on the bridge by publishing a `true` message (`std_msgs/Bool`) to the `/cmd_open_bridge` topic
  * Dock at the destination box with the least number of occurance
## Dependencies

* System Requirements:
  * Ubuntu 20.04 (18.04 not yet tested)
  * ROS Noetic (Melodic not yet tested)
  * C++11 and above
  * CMake: 3.0.2 and above
* This repo depends on the following standard ROS pkgs:
  * `roscpp`
  * `rospy`
  * `rviz`
  * `std_msgs`
  * `nav_msgs`
  * `geometry_msgs`
  * `visualization_msgs`
  * `tf2`
  * `tf2_ros`
  * `tf2_geometry_msgs`
  * `pluginlib`
  * `map_server`
  * `gazebo_ros`
  * `jsk_rviz_plugins`
  * `jackal_gazebo`
  * `jackal_navigation`
  * `velodyne_simulator`
  * `teleop_twist_keyboard`
* And this [gazebo_model](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models) repositiory

## Installation

This repo is a ros workspace, containing three rospkgs:

* `interactive_tools` are customized tools to interact with gazebo and your robot
* `jackal_description` contains the modified jackal robot model descriptions
* `me5413_world` the main pkg containing the gazebo world, and the launch files

**Note:** If you are working on this project, it is encouraged to fork this repository and work on your own fork!

After forking this repo to your own github:

```bash
# Clone your own fork of this repo (assuming home here `~/`)
cd
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/ME5413_Group5_Final_Project.git
cd ME5413_Group5_Final_Project

# Install all dependencies
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

# Build
catkin_make
# Source 
source devel/setup.bash
```

To properly load the gazebo world, you will need to have the necessary model files in the `~/.gazebo/models/` directory.

There are two sources of models needed:

* [Gazebo official models](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models)
  
  ```bash
  # Create the destination directory
  cd
  mkdir -p .gazebo/models

  # Clone the official gazebo models repo (assuming home here `~/`)
  git clone https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models.git

  # Copy the models into the `~/.gazebo/models` directory
  cp -r ~/gazebo_models/* ~/.gazebo/models
  ```

* [Our customized models](https://github.com/NUS-Advanced-Robotics-Centre/ME5413_Final_Project/tree/main/src/me5413_world/models)

  ```bash
  # Copy the customized models into the `~/.gazebo/models` directory
  cp -r ~/ME5413_Group5_Final_Project/src/me5413_world/models/* ~/.gazebo/models
  ```

## How to complete the tasks

### 0. Gazebo World

This command will launch the gazebo with the project world

```bash
# Launch Gazebo World together with our robot
roslaunch me5413_world world.launch
```

### 1. Manual Control

If you wish to explore the gazebo world a bit, we provide you a way to manually control the robot around:

```bash
# Only launch the robot keyboard teleop control
roslaunch me5413_world manual.launch
```

**Note:** This robot keyboard teleop control is also included in all other launch files, so you don't need to launch this when you do mapping or navigation.

### 2. Mapping


### 3. Navigation
To localize the boxes generated in the area and navigate the robot with a snake-like path, run the findcube.py and snake_path.py simultaneously: 
```bash
#Runing algorithm to localize the boxes
python3 findcube.py
#Runing algorithm to execute the snake-like path to explore the area
python3 snake_path.py
```
After finishing the snake-like path, subscribing to the locations, planning the shortest path by solving the Travelling Sales Man problem to visit each box one by one and recognizing the numbers on the boxes using the perception function:
```bash
#Running the perception node
python3 digit_recognition_service_node.py
#Runing algorithm to visit the boxes
subscribe_box_pos.py
```
